docker-pcurl is a docker image to download provided list of "\(c\)url links" generated by Firefox or Chrome.
Download is done in parallel via curl, while preserving the original filenames.
[How to use "Download as cURL in web browsers"](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2015/11/23/copy-as-curl/)

docker-pcurl is based on bleeding edge ```alpine``` image to provide latest and greatest ```curl``` version.
Latest version of ```curl``` is needed for ```--output-dir``` option introduced in 7.73.0, just recently.
```parallel``` is set to start running 10 jobs simultaneously, if you provide more links, they will queue automatically.
